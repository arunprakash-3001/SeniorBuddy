"SeniorBuddy," a real-time Android application that connects senior citizens with community volunteers for rides. Using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase, the app features secure, role-based login for both "Seniors" and "Volunteers." The Senior Dashboard allows users to request rides by specifying pickup/drop locations, special assistance needs, vehicle type, and a suggested fare. Volunteers see these requests instantly on their dashboard, where they can accept, manage, and complete the rides. The entire system is connected to a live Cloud Firestore database, allowing all status updates to happen in real-time.<img width="720" height="1600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ad73f3-e41e-4b05-9869-84e0658c6057" />
